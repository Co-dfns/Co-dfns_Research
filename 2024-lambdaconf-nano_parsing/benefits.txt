Nano-parsing:

∘ It is GPU compatible
∘ It decouples error reporting from the act of parsing, 
  allowing errors to be dealt with independently
∘ It allows arbitrary computation at any point
∘ Well suited for interpreters that may suffer interpretation overhead
∘ Easier to understand at scale using code inspection
∘ Easier to see what code will be impacted by a change
∘ Easy to modify a pass or insert new passes
