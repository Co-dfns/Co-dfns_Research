The author of this article, a professor at the university of Thessaly in Greece, talks about how effective and how motivational it is for students to use games while learning computer memory concepts. The program that Professor Papastergiou is using as a reference is all apart of the Greek High School Computer Science Curriculum. This study also looked at how gender might play a role in the students motivation levels and effective learning. They used a pretest in order to gauge the students knowledge of the subject that they were in, so that they could have a baseline of what it was that the students were actually learning. The results were that the boys were generally more interested in the area of games, but the difference in what a boy learned and what a girl learned had almost no significance. 

Naps, Thomas L., et al. Exploring the Role of Visualization and Engagement in Computer Science Education. ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, ACM, 2002, dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=782998.

In this article, written by Thomas L. Naps a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh, the author talks about the role that visualization has with engagement in Computer Science. Naps argues that no matter how visual or well designed something is doesn't matter if the student doesn't engage in it. Naps provides a framework that others can work with in the realm of visualization effectiveness, and use this to gauge just how well your visualization areas will do for students that are taking a course. This framework is meant to be used for experimental studies of visualization effectiveness and are meant to be used by computer science educators that want to understand their classes overall effectiveness.

Martin Ebner, A professor at the Graz University of Technology in Graz Austria, talks about the use of online game learning in higher education to teach students more complex and theoretical knowledge. He states that repetition of the material will lead to a deeper understanding of the material that is learned. In this experiment they used 121 graduate level students to gauge the effectiveness of their hypothesis. The participants had to take pre and post exams in order for the person giving the experiment to understand how well the experiment is. The results found from this experiment were that the students learned more through game based learning than they did through traditional methods.

In this article we hear from Eric Fouh, Monika Akbar, and Clifford A. Shaffer, who are all instructors or professors at Virginia Tech, and they talk about the role of visualization in computer Science Education. The authors look at how hard to understand concepts are not looked at well or understood well by students in a classroom such as Algorithms of complex data types, and look to see how they can improve upon them or other curriculum who have been able to find positive methods to do so. They state that with developments in Computer Technology it is easier than ever to have a visualization of these complex algorithms and based on their findings they saw that students were more able to engage and learn from online sources such as etextbooks and visual stimulations that were able to motivate them to learn more about the subject matter.

In this article we hear from Scott Grissom who is a professor at Grand Valley State University for the Computer Science Department, and he talks about the role that visualization has on learning advanced algorithms. He states that technology has been evolving at a faster rate than it ever has in the past, and that we need to utilize this time to help students be able to visualize what an algorithm does once it's implemented properly into our code. In the paper they present the results of a mult-university study in which they were able to test the students level of engagement with algorithms that were taught with visualization and those that were not exposed to visualization. The results from this study show that students learn more then more they are engaged with something and that they become more engaged with the more visualization that comes from a certain curriculum.

In this paper we hear from Orit Hazzan, a professor at the Israel Institute of Technology, Judith Gal-Ezer, a Professor at the Open University of Israel, and Lenore Blum, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and they talk about a model that should be followed for high school computer science education. In this model we learn about four key elements that they have found to be the best ways to teach students computer science at the high school level. They state that a student is only as good as their teacher and in order for the student to succeed in the Computer Science world, then the person teaching the class needs to understand what is best for the student. It states that the person teaching must be licensed to do so, have research in the area they are teaching, follow a strict curriculum, and take a preparation program before hand. From what they have found in other countries that do this compared to the United States, is that the countries who follow this model have much higher rates of success for their students who learn computer science than those students who learn computer science in the United States.

Cameron Whitley, the author of the Book Teaching Sociology, is a Doctor of Philosophy teaching at Rutgers University -- Camden. He had been in 18 different research items. He is expertise especially in the field of sociology, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis. His work had been cited in 104 different works. From his book Teaching Sociology, we can extract the part, titled A Picture is worth a thousand words: applying image-based learning to course design, which describes the effects of images in teaching students. He describes that image sometimes disconnect students from inputting the efforts and applying the materials into real-world. And then he explained what kind of image-based learning can make better output by making student more challenging. His work can benefit our research by giving what kind of image-based learning is more beneficial and how image-based learning can make student learn more than other method of learning.

Kara Vandas, the author of the book Partnering With Students , is a passionate educator for both middle and high school students. She has been teaching youth at-risk for almost 20 years, and now working as an author and consultant at learner agency and efficacy. She holds a Master's degree on Education and Instruction at Regis University.  As her work, we can figure out how pride of ownership in learning can boost student with more learning and encourage to have more passion on challenging tasks. This source can help our research by defining what is pride of ownership and telling us the method to boost student's will to learn something.

Matthias Felleisen the author of this book is a professor at the Northeastern University. He is the founder of the racket language and has worked extensively in programming languages as well as research in the field of programming languages education. This book is meant to be a textbook to help learn the racket language through the student oriented languages such as beginner student language and advanced student. These languages and the book help the student to learn as much as they can with quick and concise information while also providing links to a more detailed coding structure. It teaches the students how to code and how to write programs following a certain set of guidelines that are meant to help them write code that is considered to be well written and with good documentation. 

Iverson, Kenneth. ACM Turing Award Lectures: the First Twenty Years, 1966 to 1985. ACM Press, 1987.

Kenneth Iverson, the author of this paper, was the founder and creator of the APL programming language, as well as introducing Iverson language notation. In this paper Kenneth Iverson talks about the advantages that APL has when teaching and learning programming languages. He states that APL is the best language to use when trying to teach and learn programming because of the clear and concise nature of the expressions in the language and what it offers for the user. He talks about how this language is the best for the way that we think and that using this language will become rather easy to use once you learn the notation. Iverson later states that he created APL in order to have a language that was more aligned with how we were thinking as humans rather than trying to think like the computer and because of this the APL language is superior in learning a programming language as well as the ease of use for this language.

Woodcock, Jon. Coding Games in Scratch. DK Publishing, 2016.

Jon Woodcock, the writer of the book Coding Games in Scratch, is a writer who deeply interested in explaining and making people interested in technology, especially coding. He wrote numerous books about coding with easier explanation so that the starters can reach to coding and understand it in much easier way. This book is very helpful for those who looking for the coding examples of scratch, because it explains all the  scratch coding steps one by one. Not only showing the steps, but also explaining how the step works for the entire code. For our research, we used one of the games that he provided so that we can show how different the code length and complexity is compared to  APL.
