Purpose: To demonstrate the design and implementation of Co-dfns for financial 
and information expert acceleration.

Vision: People read the paper and are excited about the performance results, 
the device independence, and the ease with which the compiler can enhance 
information experts' workflows.

Ideas:

Focus on information experts
Pushing the boundaries of array programming
CPU results now, GPU results on deck
Talk about DWA benefits
Inline compilation the GPU
Cosmos
Large code bases
Type systems
Automatic runtime complexity analysis
Data parallel compilers
Performance independence through correct end user abstractions
Making the life of the information expert easier
