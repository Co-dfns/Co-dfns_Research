Title: Extending Concurrent Collections

Concurrent Collections is a dataflow style parallel programming model that
utilizes single-assignment global stores to achieve deterministic behavior. 
It allows one to describe task parallelism through high-level, declarative
descriptions.  In this talk I will introduce CnC and describe my research in
extending the language to enable richer analysis of the data access patterns
described by CnC programs. Hopefully, there will also be a demo.
