Title: Provably Correct Space-folding of CnC Programs

We present a formally define dlanguage based on the Mathematics of
Arrays and an axiomatic semantics fully mechanized in the Isabelle 
proof assistant. CnC programs are then described using this language
and a space folded, multiple assignment variant is derived rigorously 
using the semantics. We show that this derivation preserves the 
correctness of the program.
