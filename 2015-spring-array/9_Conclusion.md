The Co-dfns compiler enables information experts to convert their interpreted APL programs into efficient C and CUDA code that integrates into the Dyalog APL interpreter. This allows them to optimize hotspots in their code and to realize increased performance without rewriting key elements of their software. It also increases the range of hardware platforms available to the Dyalog APL programmer, as they are now able to execute their code on highly parallel processors like GPUs and the Xeon Phi. To achieve this performance on scalar centric algorithms like Black Scholes, integration into the interpreter makes the largest single performance difference in performance, to eliminate interpreter overheads getting data in and out of the system. After this, scalar function loop fusion becomes critical to make effective use of the cache hierarchies on modern architectures. 

In addition to producing fast code, the compiler is written as a simple, data-flow, data-parallel program without any explicit recursion, branching, or other forms of complex control-flow. The directness and concision afforded by this method demonstrates that the number of domains for which array-oriented programming is suitable is larger than commonly granted.
