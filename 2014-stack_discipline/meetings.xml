          Ed has started work on the benchmark, with an email thread
          giving some basic ideas of how to proceed with the benchmark
          in style. Specifically, he intends to have a spec written
          down by the time the semester starts. Aaron has completed
          the development and certification of Increment 3 of the
          Co-dfns compiler, with some caveats in terms of JIT
          compiling. The 4th increment is underway, but may not be
          done by the 1st of January.

          Aaron should attempt to have development, but not
          necessarily certification of Increment 4 complete by the 1st
          of January, while Ed should have the Benchmark specification
          complete by the start of the semester. Tim should complete
          his P423 work as quickly as possible.
