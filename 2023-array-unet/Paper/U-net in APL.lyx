\begin_layout Abstract
The APL notation would appear to be a clear match for convolutional neural
 networks, but traditional implementations of APL have lagged behind the
 performance of highly tuned, specialized frameworks designed to execute
 CNNs on the GPU.
 Moreover, most demonstrations of APL for neural networking have involved
 relatively small examples.
 We explore a more complex example in the U-net architecture and utilize
 a modern APL compiler with GPU support, Co-dfns, to compare the state of
 the art of APL against the current crop of specialized neural network framework
s in the form of PyTorch.
 We compare performance as well as the language design of APL for neural
 network programming and the clarity and transparency of the resulting code.

 APL source was on par with the complexity of the PyTorch reference implementati
on, albeit more foreign, while being more concise and complete.
 We also found that when compiled with Co-dfns, despite the naive implementation
 both of Co-dfns and our own code, performance on the GPU and the CPU were
 within a factor of 2.2 - 2.4 times that of the PyTorch implementation.
 We believe this suggests significant avenues of future exploration for
 machine learning language design, pedagogy, and implementation, both inside
 and outside of the APL community.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specialized machine learning frameworks dominate present deep learning applicati
ons.
 A wide number of higly specialized, optimized libraries exist.
 These systems are more complex than typical libraries and are better thought
 of as domain-specific languages (DSLs).
 While these libraries bolster the current machine learning explosion, because
 of their highly specialized nature, users tend to become specialists around
 a very specific framework for computation.
 This creates a sharp wall that impedes skills transferrence, where experts
 can use frameworks effectively but may be underprepared to handle situations
 that benefit from broader or more flexible skillsets.

 This specialization makes sense in the context of traditional programming,
 where simple networks are accessible, but tedious, while non-trivial ML
 architectures quickly strain the performance and usability of a

 implementation.
 This creates a sharp contrast between simple systems programmed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and opaque, complex frameworks that work as inflexible black boxes.
 A lack of profound and intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanics
 of deep learning systems fosters a type of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

programming by knob turning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where networks are programmed via trial and error rather than intentionality,
 further exacerbating the danger of unintended consequences already an inherent
 difficulty in statistical ML

\end_inset

.
 Machine learning frameworks are often highly vendor-specific; even more
 vendor-neutral systems encode greater specificity than historically warranted
 for long-running code intended.
 This demands higher levels of programmer investment in system maintainence
 over a product lifetime.
 Despite this, specialist frameworks prove highly effective, in part because
 of the performance demands of ML.
 However, in recent years, reemerging general-purpose array programming
 languages have presented an alternative potential direction.
 Such languages were popular during early neural network programming in
 the 20th century 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

APL, a general-purpose array programming language, created by Kenneth Iverson

, has risen in popularity over the past decades, in part because of the
 renewed interest in parallel computation and a wider acceptance of the
 use of a variety of programming languages.
 Recently, new research into APL as a machine learning language has begun.
 APL's origins in education and its reputation for direct algorithmic expression

 ML.
 As a linguistically stable language that is both high performance and high
 level 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

literal "false"

\end_inset

, it is suitable for long lived code as well as rapid prototyping, and the
 data-parallel by default semantics suggests obvious applications to GPU
 programming.
 While these advantages might recommend APL for machine learning, the majority
 of implementations have run on the CPU only, usually via interpreter.
 While challenging to compile, recent innovations to the language (particularly
 those with a functional programming focus) make compilation more tractable,
 and the Co-dfns compiler now exists as an APL implementation with native
 GPU support

Given the available APL technology and the parsity of existing research
 on modern ML in APL, we explored APL as a ML language in terms of language
 design and runtime performance by implementing and benchmarking the U-net
 convolutional neural network

.
 This is a popular image segmentation architecture with a particularly interesti
ng U-shaped design.
 It makes use of a range of popular CNN vocabularies and functions while
 having a clear, non-trivial architecture.
 This makes an ideal candidate for exploring APL's capabilities.

Convolutional Neural Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment this paper uses to produce its benchmarks is the reproduction
 of a well-known convolutional neural network architecture.
 The use of CNNs in machine learning was widely popularised with the publication
 of a paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that used CNNs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in labeling pictures
 of the ImageNet

 challenge.
 However, a proeminent paper from 1998 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 shows that the modern use of CNNs can be dated farther back.

 Convolutional layers receive three-dimensional tensors as input and produce
 three-dimensional tensors as output.
 These inputs have a fixed number of channels

 of image processing.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{in}$
\end_inset

 which are then transformed into 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{out}$
\end_inset

 channels through means of discrete convolutions with a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{in}\times n_{out}$
\end_inset

 kernels, the learnable parameters of the convolutional layer.
 One of the advantages of CNNs is that, although the total number of kernels
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{in}\times n_{out}$
\end_inset

 depends on the number of input and output channels, the sizes of the kernels
 are independent of the size of the other two dimensions of the inputs.
 Despite the fact that the main dynamics of a convolutional layer is governed
 by discrete convolution with the learnable kernels, the exact behaviour
 of a convolutional layer depends on layer parameters like the padding and
 the stride used

Given that CNNs were primarily used in image recognition-related tasks,
 convolutional layers were often paired with pooling layers that ease the
 recognition of features over small neighbourhoods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pooling"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The rationale behind these pooling layers, as seen from an image recognition-re
lated context, can be interpreted as follows: the image features one is
 typically interested in (e.g., the recognition or segmentation of objects,
 or image labeling) are not contained in single pixels of the input images,
 but in regions of said pixels.
 Pooling layers are, thus, employed with the purpose of aggregating low-level
 information that can then be used to recognise the larger features of interest

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows that after each of these convolutions, the size of the feature maps
 decreases by 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, from which it can be inferred that the stride 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 After each convolution, we use the activation function rectified linear
 unit (ReLU) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "relu"

\end_inset

.
 Pairs of these convolutions are followed by max-pooling operations represented
 by the red down arrows.
 These max-pooling operations act on a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 region and have a stride of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, effectively downsampling each feature map to half the size.
 Because of this repeated halving, the input size must be chosen carefully
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Specifically, the input dimensions must be congruent to 
\begin_inset Formula $12\mod16$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 After every downsampling step, the first convolution doubles the number
 of channels.
 The pattern of two convolutions (with ReLUs) followed by downsampling via
 max-pooling happens four times and makes up the contracting path of the
 network, on the left of Figure

\begin_layout Standard
Having reached the end of the contracting path (at the bottom of the diagram),
 we start the expanding path.
 The expanding path also makes use of unpadded convolutions with 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 kernels and stride 1, but these are now at the end of each step, instead
 of at the beginning.
 Each step of the expanding path starts with an upsampling operation (green
 up arrows) that doubles the size of the feature maps while cutting their
 number down in half.
 For this upsampling, we infer that the original authors used a transposed
 convolution (with 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 kernels) of stride 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

.
 These transpose convolutions produce half of the channels that are fed
 as input to the regular convolutions.
 The other half of the channels is copied and cropped from the corresponding
 step in the contracting path, as represented by the gray right long arrows
 in the middle of the diagram of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Because there is a slight mismatch between the size of the feature maps
 that are copied and cropped and the other feature maps that resulted from
 the upsampling step, the feature maps that are copied get cropped from
 the centre of the larger feature maps of the contracting path.
 It is after this copy and crop operation that we feed the feature maps
 into the two convolution layers that are paired with their respective ReLU
 activation functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of the contracting path, we have a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times1$

 Thus,

 Then, the APL function

 argument vector from its left argument.
 Similarly, the division example shows that vectors can also be used as
 the left argument.
 The natural progression is to wonder whether vectors can be used on the
 left and on the right of a function, and typically they can.
 We demonstrate that with the

 Scalar functions are functions that pervade the structure of the argument(s)
 and apply directly to each of the scalars that make up said argument(s).
 This becomes increasingly relevant when one understands that APL has first-clas
s support for arrays of any dimension, of which we have seen 
\emph on
scalars
\emph default
 such as 
\family typewriter
10
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
73
\family default
 and 
\emph on
vectors
\emph default
.
 Scalars and vectors can be typed directly but arrays of higher dimensions
 must be loaded from an external data source or created dynamically through
 computations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reshape function is represented by the Greek letter rho 
\family typewriter
⍴
\family default
 and is a dyadic function that reshapes its right argument to have the shape
 specified by the left argument.
 For instance, if we want to create a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix with the first six non-negative integers, we can do it like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      2 3 ⍴ 0 1 2 3 4 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
0 1 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
3 4 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each non-negative integer of the left argument specifies the length of the
 result along the corresponding dimension.
 So, if the left argument had been 
\family typewriter
5 9 7
\family default
, the resulting array would have been a cuboid (array with three dimensions)
 composed of 
\family typewriter
5
\family default
 planes, 
\family typewriter
9
\family default
 rows, and 
\family typewriter
7
\family default
 columns, holding a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times9\times7=315$
\end_inset

 items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an arbitrary array 
\family typewriter
array
\family default
, we can also use the Greek letter rho 
\family typewriter
⍴
\family default
 to compute the 
\emph on
shape
\emph default
 of the array, that is, the length of each of its 
\emph on
axis
\emph default
, or dimensions.
 In the example below, we can see that 
\family typewriter
array
\family default
 is a matrix with 
\family typewriter
2
\family default
 rows and 
\family typewriter
3
\family default
 columns, even though we don't know what the items of 
\family typewriter
array
\family default
 are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      ⍴array
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
2 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also goes to show that many functions have two behaviours, one monadic
 behaviour and one dyadic behaviour.
 A function is used monadically when it has an array argument on its right,
 but not on its left, and a function is used dyadically when it has an array
 argument on its left and another one on its right.
 For example, rho 
\family typewriter
⍴
\family default
 represents the monadic function 
\emph on
shape
\emph default
 and the dyadic function 
\emph on
reshape
\emph default
.
 In this particular instance, we can also see that 
\family typewriter
array
\family default
 is a 
\emph on
nested
\emph default
 matrix:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      array

\begin_layout Verbatim

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
│1 0│1 1│1 2│
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
└───┴───┴───┘
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cells above each contain a two-item vector (
\family typewriter
0 0
\family default
 through 
\family typewriter
1 2
\family default
), and the borders surrounding those two-item vectors are a visual cue to
 help the reader discern the nested nature of the array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another key difference between the APL notation and the traditional mathematical
 notation is that APL normalises precedence rules by saying that all functions
 have the same precedence: functions are said to have a 
\emph on
long right scope
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
short left scope
\emph default
, which is why APL is often said to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

execute from right to left
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A long right scope means that a function takes as right argument everything
 to its right, whereas a short left scope means that a function only takes
 as left argument the array that is immediately to its left.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times3-4\times5$
\end_inset

, in standard mathematical notation, is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $(2\times3)-(4\times5)=6-20=-14$
\end_inset

, because multiplication has higher precedence over subtraction.
 However, the APL expression 
\family typewriter
2×3-4×5
\family default
 is equivalent to 
\family typewriter
2×(3-(4×5))
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim

\begin_layout Standard
On top of providing a rich set of built-in functions, APL provides a series
 of operators that allow us to combine and modify our functions.
 A typical example of a monadic APL operator is 
\emph on
reduce-first
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
⌿
\family default
.
 The monadic operator 
\emph on
reduce-first
\emph default
 takes a function on its left and then inserts it between the elements of
 the right argument.
 Previously, we computed the total number of elements in a cuboid with shape
 
\family typewriter
5 9 7
\family default
 by inserting the 
\emph on
times
\emph default
 function between each pair of numbers.
 With 
\emph on
reduce-first
\emph default
, this can be simplified:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      5×9×7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
315
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      ×⌿5 9 7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
315
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\emph on
times
\emph default
, together with the operator 
\emph on
reduce-first
\emph default
, creates the 
\emph on
derived function
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
×⌿
\family default
, recognised as the function 
\emph on
product
\emph default
.
 Similarly, the derived function 
\family typewriter
+⌿
\family default
 is the function 
\emph on
sum
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      1+2+3+4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      +⌿1 2 3 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This highlights the versatility of APL in that operators combine with a
 variety of functions.
 Another source of versatility in APL comes from how functions get applied
 to arrays of different ranks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator 
\emph on
reduce-first
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
⌿
\family default
 gets its name by contrast with the operator 
\emph on
reduce
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
/
\family default
, given that the two operators differ in the axis along which their derived
 functions operate.
 With the help of the function 
\emph on
index generator
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
⍳
\family default
 and the 
\emph on
left arrow
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
←
\family default
 that performs assignment, we can create a matrix 
\family typewriter

\family default
 with shape 
\family typewriter

\family default
 and demonstrate the difference between the two derived functions 
\family typewriter

\family default

 sums along the first axis of its argument and 
\emph on

\emph default
 
\family typewriter
+/
\family default
 sums along the last axis of its argument.
 For higher-rank arrays, an arbitrary axis can be specified with the 
\emph on
axis operator
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
[axis]
\family default
.
 For example, the construct 
\family typewriter
+/[0]
\family default
 uses 
\emph on

\emph default
 with 
\emph on

\emph default
to replicate the behaviour of

On top of monadic operators, that take a single operand on the left, APL

\family typewriter

User-defined Functions and Operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In APL, one can use the 
\emph on
direct functions (dfns)
\emph default
 syntax to create user-defined functions, which can then be named and reused
 throughout the APL programs.
 A dfn is enclosed by braces 
\family typewriter
{}
\family default
 and it can only take a right argument, or a left and right argument.
 Inside a dfn, we use 
\emph on
omega
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
⍵
\family default
 to refer to the right argument and 
\emph on
alpha
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
⍺
\family default
 to refer to the left argument.
 We provide a short example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      vec ← 0 1 2 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      (+⌿vec)÷≢vec      ⍝ Sum of vec divided by its tally
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
1.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      avg ← {(+⌿⍵)÷≢⍵}  ⍝ Sum of arg divided by its tally
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
      avg vec
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verbatim
1.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the 
\emph on
direct operators (dops)
\emph default
 syntax can be used to create user-defined operators.
 A dop is also enclosed by braces 
\family typewriter
{}
\family default
 and it can only take a left operand 
\family typewriter
⍺⍺
\family default
 if it is a monadic operator, or a left 
\family typewriter
⍺⍺
\family default
 and a right 
\family typewriter
⍵⍵
\family default
 operand if it is a dyadic operator.
 Inside a dop, 
\family typewriter
⍵
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
⍺
\family default
 still refer to the arguments of the derived function.
 For example, given a dyadic function 
\family typewriter
f
\family default
 and a monadic function 
\family typewriter
g
\family default
, the pattern

Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our implementation of u-net can be roughly divided into two significant
 considerations: the implementation of the fundamental vocabulary of neural
 networks, and the wiring of those operations into the actual u-net architecture.
 We leveraged significant features of APL to implement both aspects of the
 system, and so we will treat each in their own sub-section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, because Co-dfns does not yet support the complete array of
 Dyalog primitives and their semantics, some of the implementation techniques
 that we use could be significantly enhanced through the use of a more rich
 feature-set.
 The effect of using these richer features is an increase in concision and
 clarity, but we expect that such improvements would not significantly affect
 the overall performance of the code, either positively or negatively.
 We believe that the overall structure of the code is clear and simple enough
 at the current state of Co-dfns to warrant inclusion almost verbatim here,
 rather than use the richer features and require the reader to translate
 those into the Co-dfns supported feature set in order to execute them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One area that deserves particular attention is the design of APL as a language
 itself and the specific features that immediately present themselves as
 particularly well-suited to expressing neural network computations.
 Our exploration of these features uncovered a particular design tension
 that is worth discussing in detail.
 A complete copy of the code discussed in this paper is included in the
 appendix.

\begin_layout Subsection
Design of APL Primitives for Neural Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of APL primitives find fundamental use in computing neural
 networks, which isn't surprising given the array-oriented and numerical
 nature of the domain.
 However, the stencil operator, introduced in Dyalog APL 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "stencil-lives"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, stands out as the most obviously aligned with convolutional neural networks.
 The J programming language introduced an alternative implementation of
 the stencil operator earlier 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "stencil-in-J"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, from which Dyalog derived inspiration for the implementation of their
 own stencil operator.
 We propose an alternative that was first suggested to us by the late Roger
 Hui, the stencil 
\emph on
function
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "SF-hui-blog"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The stencil function is a function whose left argument is the same as the
 right operand of the stencil operator, and which receives the same right
 argument as the right argument to the function returned by the stencil
 operator.
 A reasonable definition of the stencil function using the Dyalog stencil

A naïve implementation of the stencil function that did not pad its results
 was implemented in Co-dfns and used in the following implementations.
 In the following sections, we use

 to mean the stencil

 and not the stencil operator as it appears in Dyalog APL.
 Given a specification

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Convolution (3×3) with ReLU
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary u-net convolutional layer is a 3×3 convolution with a ReLU activatio
n function.
 The convolution in the paper uses 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 convolutions, meaning that no padding is used.
 This implies that the convolution dimensions of the output array shrink
 by 2 for each dimension compared to the input.
 We define the forward propagation function 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 as a function over a set of kernels 
\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{⍺}$
\end_inset

 and a layer 
\begin_inset Formula $\texttt{⍵}$
\end_inset

 that obeys the following shape invariant:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho\,\alpha\,CV\,\omega & \leftrightarrow & (^{-}2+2↑\rho\omega),{}^{-}1↑\rho\alpha
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

We write 
\begin_inset Formula $S↑A$
\end_inset

 to describe the array derived from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 whose shape is equal to the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 except that the leading dimensions of 
\begin_inset Formula $S↑A$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $|S$
\end_inset

 (absolute value over 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

), read as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the S take of A.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Negative values in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 take from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

far
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trailing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 side of the dimension.
 Thus, the resulting shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\,CV\,\omega$
\end_inset

 is the leading dimensions of the input 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 subtracted by 2 catenated with the final dimension (the output channels)
 of kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 In the case of a u-net layer, we have input kernels of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $3\,3\,I\,O$
\end_inset

 and input layer of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $N M I$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N M$
\end_inset

 are the image/layer dimensions, and 
\begin_inset Formula $I O$
\end_inset

 are the input and output channel counts, respectively.
 The resulting output layer has shape 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-2) (M-2) O$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the stencil function, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 as follows for rank 4 kernel inputs and rank 3 layer inputs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
CV & ← & \{0⌈(,\texttt{⍤}3⊢3\,3\texttt{⌺}\omega)\mathnormal{+.×},[\iota3]\alpha\}\label{eq:CV}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

We include the ReLU function 
\begin_inset Formula $0⌈\omega$
\end_inset

 as the final operation following the convolution.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula $,\texttt{⍤}3⊢\omega$
\end_inset

 to describe the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 with its 3 trailing dimensions collapsed into a single dimension.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula $,[\iota3]\omega$
\end_inset

 to describe the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 with its leading 3 dimensions likewise collapsed.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Operators"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we presented 
\begin_inset Formula $+.×$
\end_inset

 as the matrix product form of the operator inner product, and in 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 we use its extension to arrays of arbitrary rank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computing the backpropagation uses very similar approaches.
 Given the output layer 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, input layer 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, activation layer 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, weights 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, and the gradient backpropagated so far 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, we compute the transposed weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, the derivative output layer 
\begin_inset Formula $∆z$
\end_inset

 , the weight gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $∆w$
\end_inset

, padded output layer 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Z$
\end_inset

, and the resulting back gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $∆x$
\end_inset

 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
w & ← & \ominus\obar[1]0\,1\,3\,2\obslash\alpha\nonumber \\
∆z & ← & \omega×0<a\\
∆w & ← & 3\,0\,1\,2\obslash(\obslash,[\iota2]\Delta z)\mathnormal{+.×},[\iota2]3\,3\texttt{⌺}x\\
\Delta Z & ← & ^{-}2\ominus{}^{-}2\obar[1](4+2↑\rho\Delta z)↑\Delta z\nonumber \\
∆x & ← & (,\texttt{⍤}3⊢3\,3\texttt{⌺}\Delta Z)\mathnormal{+.×},[\iota3]w
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Since our stencil function does not pad its results, the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $^{-}2\ominus{}^{-}2\obar[1](4+2↑\rho\Delta z)↑\Delta z$
\end_inset

 expands the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z$
\end_inset

 to ensure that the output convolution dimensions are 2 greater than those
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z$
\end_inset

, where the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\ominus$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\obar$
\end_inset

 are functions to rotate an array.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\obar[1]$
\end_inset

 rotates an array along the 
\begin_inset Formula $1st$
\end_inset

 dimension while 
\begin_inset Formula $\ominus$
\end_inset

 rotates along the leading axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Copy and Crop
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conceptually, the copy and crop operation is the simplest of the functions
 in u-net.
 Its sole job is to take the output from one side of the U-shaped net and
 move it over to the other side, adjusting the dimensions to ensure that
 it fits.
 In the forward direction, the input layer will have a greater dimension
 than the output layer, so we crop as evenly as possible around the edges
 and then catenate the result at the head of the layer coming 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the network to form the output layer with twice the channels of the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 layer.
 The following function 
\begin_inset Formula $CC$
\end_inset

 computes the crop of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 catenated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula $↓$
\end_inset

 (read as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drop
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), which is the opposite function of the previously described 
\begin_inset Formula $↑$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

take
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
CC & ← & \left\{ \begin{aligned}p\leftarrow & ((\rho\alpha)-\rho\omega)÷2),\omega\\
 & ((⌊p)↓(-⌈p)↓\alpha
\end{aligned}
\right\} 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

For dimensions that are not evenly divisible by two, we choose to round
 up on the right and bottom sides and round down on the left and upper sides
 of the layer.
 Computing the backpropagation of 
\begin_inset Formula $CC$
\end_inset

 given the input 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and output gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 simply reverses this operation and expands the shape back to the original
 input size.
 This result is then added to the appropriate layer in the u-net architecture
 described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:U-net-Architecture"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
n\,m & ← & -⌊(2↑(\rho\alpha)-\rho\omega)÷2\nonumber \\
\Delta x & ← & n\ominus m\obar[1](\rho\alpha)↑\omega
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Max Pooling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Max pooling is a shrinking convolution that computes the maximum value in
 a non-overlapping sliding window.
 Given the stencil function, the max pool over a layer is given by the following
 expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
⌈⌿[2],[2\,3](2\,2\rho2)\texttt{⌺}\omega\label{eq:MX}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Here we write 
\begin_inset Formula $⌈⌿[2],[2\,3]\omega$
\end_inset

 to describe an array where we have collapsed dimensions 2 and 3 and computed
 the maximum value reduction over the resulting dimension.
 For example, given an input layer 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $N\,M\,C$
\end_inset

, the result of 
\begin_inset Formula $(2\,2\rho2)\texttt{⌺}\omega$
\end_inset

 is a rank 5 array of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $(N÷2)(M÷2)2\,2\,C$
\end_inset

.
 We then collapse the 
\begin_inset Formula $2nd$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3rd$
\end_inset

 dimensions to form an array of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $(N÷2)(M÷2)4\,C$
\end_inset

 and subsequently find the maximum value for each vector along the 
\begin_inset Formula $2nd$
\end_inset

 dimension, resulting in an array of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $(N\div2)(M\div2)C$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computing the backpropagation of this involves replicating each of the stencil
 dimensions, which are the two leading axes in our implementation.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula $n⌿A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n/[1]A$
\end_inset

 to indicate the array 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with each element duplicated or repeated along the first and second axes,
 respectively, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 times.
 Given an input 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and output layer 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 the following expression computes the backpropagation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y\times\alpha=y←(\rho\alpha)↑2⌿2/[1]\omega
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transposed Convolution (2×2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the initial exploration of this implementation, the upsampling computation
 with convolution proved to be the most subtle and challenging, mostly in
 part to the opaqueness of implementations.
 The u-net paper was not immediately transparent regarding the exact operations
 used for this layer and there were a number of potential design decisions
 that could have been made.
 Moreover, for users reading about upsampling through convolutions, the
 descriptions are also the furthest removed from a reasonable implementation
 of the same.
 However, once the intuition of how an upsampling convolution matches the
 shape and form of a non-overlapping sliding window in the output layer,
 expressed via the simple expression 
\begin_inset Formula $K⊂\texttt{⍤}\times\texttt{⍤}2\,0⊢A$
\end_inset

, the computation becomes much clearer.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this convolution, we change the anticipated kernel shape from that used
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 above.
 Whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 expects kernels of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $3\,3\,I\,O$
\end_inset

, our transposed convolutions expect kernels of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $I\,2\,2\,O$
\end_inset

 for input channels 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 and output channels 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 Given a layer of our standard shape 
\begin_inset Formula $N\,M\,I$
\end_inset

, this gives the following definition for the upsampling pass.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
UP & \leftarrow & \{\mathnormal{,}[\iota2]\,\mathnormal{,}[2\,3]\rho0\,2\,1\,3\,4\obslash\omega\,\mathnormal{+.\times}\,\alpha\}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The key change here from the reliance on 
\begin_inset Formula $+.\times$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 is the use of a dyadic transpose 
\begin_inset Formula $0\,2\,1\,3\,4\obslash$
\end_inset

.
 Dyadic transpose is sometimes considered a somewhat challenging concept
 in APL.
 In brief, for a rank 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 array 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and targeting array 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho D)\equiv\rho S$
\end_inset

, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $D\obslash A$
\end_inset

 to describe a transposed array with shape 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $T[D]\leftarrow S$
\end_inset

, assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\land⌿D\in\iota\rho S$
\end_inset

, that is, all dimensions of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are mentioned in 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 So, given a targeting array 
\begin_inset Formula $0\,2\,1\,3\,4$
\end_inset

 and an input array 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $N\,M\,2\,2\,O$
\end_inset

, the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $0\,2\,1\,3\,4\obslash A$
\end_inset

 describes an array with elements from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $N\,2\,M\,2\,O$
\end_inset

.
 As the final operation, we collapse the first two pairs of leading dimensions,
 giving a final output array of shape 
\begin_inset Formula $(N\times2)(M\times2)O$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compute the backpropagation pass, we compute the convolutions on a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 sliding window with stride 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta w & \leftarrow & (\obslash\,\mathnormal{,}[\iota2]x)\,\mathnormal{+.\times}\,\mathnormal{,}[\iota2](2\,2\rho2)\texttt{⌺}\Delta z\\
\Delta x & \leftarrow & (\mathnormal{,}[2+\iota3](2\,2\rho\,2)\texttt{⌺}\Delta z)\,\mathnormal{+.\times}\obslash\texttt{⍪}\alpha
\end{eqnarray}

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Final 1×1 Convolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final convolution is a 1×1 convolution with 2 output channels, which
 means that it collapses the final incoming channels into an output layer
 with only two channels.
 This gives the trivial simplification of our convolution code over layer
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega+.\times\alpha
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Additionally, the paper describes using a soft-max layer, which we include
 at this phase:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
1e^{-}8+z\div[\iota2]\mathnormal{+/}z\leftarrow*\omega-[\iota2]\lceil/\omega
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computing the backpropagation is likewise a simplification of the more complex
 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta w & \leftarrow & (\obslash\,\mathnormal{,}[\iota2]x)\mathnormal{+.\times}\,\mathnormal{,}[\iota2]\Delta z\\

Given the core vocabularies defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Neural-Network-Vocabulary"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, the remaining challenge with implementing u-net is to link together the
 appropriate layers and compositions to form the complete network as described
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:unet-architecture"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 To do this, we observe that the structure of the u-net diagram is an almost
 symmetric pattern.
 The output layer computations form 3 operations which are not part of the
 pattern, but the rest of the pattern decomposes into 4 depths, each with
 6 operations each.

 contains a visual arrangement of the kernel shapes used in our architecture
 mirroring the overall structure of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, we note that the U-shaped structure also mimicks the down
 and up nature of a recursive program call-tree.
 Thus, our overall strategy is to implement a recursive function 
\begin_inset Formula $LA$
\end_inset

 that receives an index identifying a particular depth of the network, computes
 the appropriate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

downward pass
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operations before recuring deeper into the network and finally computing
 the upwards passes on the return of its recursive call.
 We likewise implement backpropagation in same way, but in the opposite
 direction.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 contains the computed depth offset for the network layer, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha+i$
\end_inset

 to access the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th column of the network described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:A-rectangular-arrangement"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 at the depth 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\div6$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our forward pass function is responsible for initializing an appropriate
 holding place for the intermediate results produced by forward propagation
 for use by the backpropagation function.
 Additionally, after the recursive computation, there are the final three
 operations, 
\begin_inset Formula $C1$
\end_inset

 and two 
\begin_inset Formula $CV$
\end_inset

 operations, that must be called before returning.
 We also assume that we may receive a rank 2 matrix instead of a rank 3
 layer as input, and so we reshape the input to ensure that we always have
 a rank 3 input to 
\begin_inset Formula $LA$
\end_inset

.
 This gives us the following function definition:

To examine the performance profile of our APL implementation, we primarily
 focused on comparing our u-net implementation against a reference implemented
 in PyTorch 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pytorch"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which is an easy to use Python framework with good performance.
 In addition to this primary performance analysis, we examined the performance
 of two varieties of stencil computations within the APL language.
 We also make note of some small exploratory effects that we discovered
 while implementing the stencil function and convolutions in Co-dfns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
U-net Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were primarily interested in the costs of executing a single run of the
 u-net over a single image source in both the forwards and backwards directions.
 We compared performance over the following platforms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dyalog APL 18.0 64-bit Windows interpreter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Co-dfns (v4.1.0 master branch) using the CUDA backend (AF v3.8.1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize
PyTorch v1.10.2 with the multi-threaded CPU backend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PyTorch v1.10.2 with the single-threaded CPU backend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of the execution can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Performance-results-for"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The timings do not include the cost of reading the image data from disk,
 but they do include the costs of transferring the image input data and
 the resulting error and forward propagation results back to the CPU main
 memory.
 In our testing, data transfer costs in Co-dfns accounted for significantly
 less than 5% of the total runtime.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hardware used was an NVIDA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU with 8GB of dedicated
 graphics memory.
 We used NVIDIA driver version 511.65.
 The CPU was an Intel Core i7-10870H with 16 logical cores @ 2.2GHz.
 Main system memory was 32GB of DDR4 RAM.
 The system was running an up to date release of Microsoft Windows 11.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As input we used the original image data from the ISBI benchmark referenced
 in the u-net paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "unet,isbi-data"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These images are 
\begin_inset Formula $512\times512$
\end_inset

 images in grayscale with a binary mask for training.
 Each run took one of these images and associated training mask and computed
 the result of forward and backwards propagation and the error as well as
 updating the weights for the network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When working on the network, APL implementations generally do not have a
 concept of small floating point values.
 Rather, their default is to always use 64-bit floating point values when
 floats are called for.
 In order to try to mimic this behavior as closely as possible, we attempted
 to feed 64-bit data into the PyTorch models.
 However, because of the opaqueness of the PyTorch implementation, we were
 not able to fully verify that 64-bit values are used throughout the PyTorch
 computational network.
 On the other hand, the reliance on 64-bit only floating points, while a
 boon to convenience and user-friendliness for non-computer science programmers,
 creates well-defined performance issues for an application like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When running the benchmark, we computed the average of 10 runs, ensuring
 that we discarded the first run each time, since these runs often contained
 significant setup and bootstrapping code (PyTorch's optimizer, the JIT
 optimization in Co-dfns, and so forth).
 The figure includes information about the variance of the individual runs
 as well as the average run time in seconds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining the data, it is clear why traditional APL implementations were
 relatively unsuited to extensive use within the machine learning space.
 Dyalog's interpreter preformed the slowest by a very large magnitude.
 After this, the single-threaded CPU implementations in Co-dfns and PyTorch
 are predictably the next slowest, with the Co-dfns implementation running
 about a factor of 2.2 times slower than the equivalent PyTorch implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When acceleration techniques are employed, the differences in execution
 speed begin to shrink, with PyTorch's multi-threaded and GPU-based implementati
ons coming in fasted, and Co-dfns' GPU backend running at roughly 2.4 times
 slower than the PyTorch GPU execution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed the widest variance in performance results in the Co-dfns CPU
 and Dyalog interpreter-based runs, and very little variance in the GPU-based
 runs or in PyTorch itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Co-dfns Runtime Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stencil function was modeled in APL and used to conduct the above benchmark.
 The model, written in APL, is a naive implementation of the stencil function
 and contains no special optimizations other than to distinguish between
 sliding windows of step 1 and non-overlapping, adjacent windows (such as
 used for the max pooling layers).
 Additionally, no specialized code was used within Co-dfns that was specific
 or specialized to neural network programming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above benchmark therefore represents a comparison of the PyTorch implementat
ion against a naive and unspecialized implementation in APL executed with
 the general-purpose runtime used in Co-dfns that provides generalized GPU
 computation but does not include domain-specific optimizations such as
 those available in PyTorch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, specialized frameworks for deep neural networks are still the best
 way to go in order to achieve the absolute maximum in performance at present.
 However, our results indicate that the gap between reliance on specialized
 frameworks and the freedom to use more general purpose and transferrable
 programming languages while still achieving competitive performance is
 not nearly as large as might have been the case even a few years ago.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that almost zero special optimization is taking place for the APL
 implementation executed under the Co-dfns runtime, it is impressive that
 we are able to see results that come close to a factor of 2 of the specialized
 frameworks.
 Given some of the obvious design issues that would contribute to slower
 performance, it seems more reasonable to be able to expect more general
 purpose languages like APL to be able to reach performance parity with
 specialized frameworks, without the requirement that the user learn a special
 API, or import specialized dependencies.
 In more complex applications that leverage APL for other domain-intensive
 work, this suggests that APL might facilitate scaling such applications
 to integrate machine learning algorithms more easily and with less programmer
 effort than might be required to integrate a separate framework like PyTorch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
APL vs.
 Frameworks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have demonstrated that APL itself, without libraries or additional dependenci
es, is exceptionally well suited to expressing neural network computations,
 at a level of inherent complexity that is arguably equal or possibly even
 less than that of the reference PyTorch implementation.
 At the very least, it is less code with less underlying background code
 and layers.
 This comes at the admittedly heavy cost of being completely foreign and
 alien to most programmers who are more familiar with languages like Python.
 This certainly creates a fundamental and immediate learning cost to APL
 over other frameworks, since other frameworks can assume a wider range
 of pre-knowledge around their chosen language implementation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains unclear, however, whether, if this pre-knowledge were taken away,
 APL would represent a compelling value proposition for such programming
 tasks or not.
 Indeed, it is exceptionally challenging to divorce the present reality
 of prior background knowledge from such a question.
 Even fundamental knowledge like what it means to do array programming and
 how to structure problems in an array-style are rarely if ever taught at
 universities, whereas most classes spend significant amounts of time teaching
 students how to utilize the Python-style programming model of PyTorch.

The argument that APL may be used more widely and broadly than PyTorch on
 a wider range of problems using the same skillset may not matter to users
 who are only interested in deep learning algorithms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
APL presently has a higher barrier to entry, but rewards the user with full
 and effortless control over what's being done in a way that other systems
 do not.
 This may present itself as a distinct advantage to users who are looking
 to expand

off the beaten track
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and utilize novel approaches that do not easily fit within existing frameworks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We encountered significant difficulties in identifying exactly what the
 original authors did based on their paper alone because of many implementation
 details that were omitted.
 On the other hand, APL enables us to express our entire implementation
 in a way that makes every implementation detail clear, improving the ability
 of others to reproduce our work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in the implementation of u-net in APL, we gained insights into
 the architecture that had a direct and material influence on the PyTorch
 reference implementation that would not have emerged without first having
 studied the APL implementation.
 Thus, we gained significant insight simply from doing the APL implementation,
 even if we were to re-implement that code in PyTorch.

Related Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two particular avenues of research warrant particular mention here.
 In addition to the Co-dfns compiler, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bernecky-cnn"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 have explored alternative implementations to CNNs, though not u-net specificall
y.
 They focused specifically on APL as a productivity enhancement for CNN
 development, and only benchmarked the APL implementation on the CPU using
 the Dyalog APL interpreter.
 However, they indicated work in progress on a compiled version using the
 APEX compiler with a SaC backend.
 Their conclusion regarding the performance of APL-based systems may have
 been premature given the results we found here, but they make a case for
 the usability of APL even with the performance numbers they achieved.
 While their code exhibits some material differences to that given here,
 there are nonetheless some similarities that demonstrate some level of
 convergence around implementing CNNs in APL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another approach to GPU-based array programming with an APL focus is the
 TAIL/Futhark system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "futhark"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which is a compiler chain taking APL to the TAIL (Typed Array Intermediate
 Language) and then compiling TAIL code using the Futhark GPU compiler backend.
 While the authors are not aware of any work implementing complex neural
 networks with this chain, it represents an interesting approach to compilation
 of APL via typed intermediate languages, which have the potential to enhance
 the fusion that can be done with an operation like the stencil function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other programming environments that are often categorized as array programming
 environments, such as Matlab 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "matlab"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, Julia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "julia"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and Python/ Numpy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "python,numpy"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, are not exceptionally performant on their own for machine learning, but
 often wrap libraries to do so.
 Unfortunately, many of these languages use a syntax that much more closely
 mirrors that of Python than APL.
 In our perspective, this reduces the value proposition of such languages
 over using specialized frameworks, since one does not obtain the particular
 clarity and productivity benefits associated with the APL notation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most obvious questions to answer in future work is the reason
 for the slower performance of the specialized convolution functions against
 our naive implementation when using the same backend in Co-dfns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of design elements of the current crop of APL implementations
, including Co-dfns, which hamper performance for machine learning.
 Especially, the use of 64-bit floating points without any feature to reduce
 their size makes memory usage a concern.
 Additionally, no optimization on the design of stencil has been done, while
 optimizations related to lazy indexing, batch processing, and a number
 of other features seem readily accessible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, we would like to explore the potential of using such systems
 to improve machine learning pedagogy by encouraging students to have access
 to high-performance, but also transparent, implementations of foundational
 machine learning concepts.
 There are still some challenges to recommending this approach at scale
 for a large number of educational institutions, but we believe work on
 understanding the pedagogical benefits of APL warrants further research
 in addition to exploring APL in the professional space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the notational advantages of APL and the concision and clarity of
 expression that one can obtain, we explored the potential impact of using
 APL as a language for implementing convolutional neural networks of reasonable
 complexity.
 We found that, though the traditional implementations of APL suffer from
 performance issues that would prevent widespread use in either academic,
 educational, or industrial contexts, compilers such as Co-dfns are capable
 of compiling complete neural network programs (in our case, the u-net architect
ure) and producing much more competitive performance results (within a factor
 of 2.2 - 2.4 times of our reference PyTorch implementation).
 This is despite the naive nature of our implementation and the naive optimizati
on support for neural networks on the part of the Co-dfns compiler.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we found that our effort to implement u-net in APL resulted
 in a concise but fully unambiguous implementation that provided transparency
 over the entire source, without any frameworks or library dependencies.
 Despite being a complete 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 implementation, its complexity of expression is on par with that of PyTorch
 and other specialized frameworks, or even better, particularly in cases
 where more exploration and novel implementation is required, or when customized
 integrations may be called for.
 The insights that we gained from implementing u-net in APL affected our
 implementation of a reference implementation in PyTorch directly, suggesting
 that APL may have significant pedagogical advantages for teaching neural
 network programming and machine learning in general.
