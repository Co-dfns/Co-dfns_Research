We explored the use of Iverson-style array programming and its effect on commonly used Image-based learning problems. This study was meant to examine what effect, if any, the use of Iverson-style array programming might have with respect to positive learning outcomes for computing curricula. In particular, we focused how Iverson-style array programming's tendency towards efficient, concise code might impact a student's breadth of knowledge, the transferrability of their skills, and the pride of ownership they might feel in their work.

Our results suggest that Iverson-style array programming results in very small code solutions that enable teachers to progress through a problem using minimal scaffolding or specialized code. By making non-scaffolded solutions more accessible to students, we believe that Iverson-style programming has potential to improve the scalability of a student's skills, their ability to transfer those skills to new domains, and their sense of ownership in the code that they write.
